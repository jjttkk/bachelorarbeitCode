\title{Cardinality and Representation of Stone Relation Algebras}
\author{Walter Guttmann}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In relation algebras, which model unweighted graphs, the cardinality operation counts the number of edges of a graph.
  We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality.
  We also give a representation theorem for Stone relation algebras.

\noindent
The theories formally verify results in \cite{FurusawaGuttmann2023}.
See this papers for further details and related work.
Stone relation algebras have been introduced in \cite{Guttmann2017b} and formalised in \cite{Guttmann2017a}.
