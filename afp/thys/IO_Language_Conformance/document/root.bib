abstract="In this paper, we propose a novel unifying approach to characterising well-known conformance relations between finite state machines, including equivalence, reduction, and variations thereof. This approach is based on languages over input/output alphabets. It allows for easier comparison between conformance relations, and gives rise to a fundamental necessary and sufficient criterion for conformance testing.",
