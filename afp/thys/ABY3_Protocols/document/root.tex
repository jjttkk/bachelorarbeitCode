\title{ABY3 Multiplication and Array Shuffling}
\author{Shuwei Hu}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalizes two protocols from a privacy-preserving machine-learning framework based on ABY3 \cite{mohassel2018aby3},
a particular three-party computation framework where inputs are systematically `reshared'
without being considered as privacy leakage.
In particular, we consider the multiplication protocol \cite{mohassel2018aby3} and the array shuffling protocol \cite{laud2016secure},
both based on ABY3's additive secret sharing scheme.
We proved their security in the semi-honest setting under the ideal/real simulation paradigm.
These two proof-of-concept opens the door to further verification of more protocols within the framework.
