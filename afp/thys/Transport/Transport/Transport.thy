paragraph \<open>Summary\<close>
text \<open>We formalise the theory for the Transport framework.
The Transport framework allows us to transport terms along (partial) Galois
connections (@{term "galois.galois_connection"}) and equivalences
(@{term "galois.galois_equivalence"}).
For details, refer to \<^cite>\<open>"transport"\<close>.\<close>
