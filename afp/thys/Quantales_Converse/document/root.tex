\begin{abstract}
  This AFP entry provides mathematical components for modal quantales,
  involutive quantales and Dedekind quantales. Modal quantales are
  simple extensions of modal Kleene algebras useful for the
  verification of recursive programs. Involutive quantales appear in
  the study of $C^\ast$-algebras. Dedekind quantales are relatives of
  Tarski's relation algebras, hence relevant to program verification
  and beyond that to higher  rewriting. We also provide
  components for weaker variants such as Kleene algebras with converse
  and modal Kleene algebras with converse.

\section{Introductory Remarks}

In this AFP entry we provide mathematical components for modal
quantales, involutive quantales and Dedekind quantales. Modal
quantales are simple extensions of modal Kleene algebras that can be
used in the verification of recursive
programs~\cite{GomesS16}. Involutive quantales appear in the study of
$C^\ast$-algebras~\cite{Resende18}. Dedekind quantales,
categorifications of which are known as \emph{modular
  quantaloids}~\cite{Rosenthal96}, are relatives of Tarski's relation
algebras~\cite{Tarski41}, and hence relevant to program verification
as well. We also provide components for weaker variants such as Kleene
algebras and modal Kleene algebras with converse.

Our main interest in these structures comes from recent applications
in higher-dimensional rewriting~\cite{CalkGMS22,CalkMPS23}, where they
are used in coherence proofs for rewriting systems based on computads
or polygraphs. This includes proofs of coherent Church-Rosser theorems
and coherent Newman's lemmas. A more long-term programme considers
the formalisation of algebraic aspects of higher rewriting with proof
assistants.

  Modal quantales have previously been studied
  in~\cite{FahrenbergJSZ23}, where it is shown, for instance, that any
  category can be lifted to a modal quantale at powerset level. Such
  lifting results will be formalised in a companion AFP entry.

  Dedekind quantales give also rise to intuitionistic modal algebras,
  as the results in this AFP entry show. In particular, the set of all
  subidentities or coreflexives of a Dedekind quantale forms a
  complete Heyting algebra (aka frame or locale), on which modal box
  and diamond operators can be defined. A paper explaining these
  results is in preparation~\cite{PousS23}. A further application of
  Dedekind quantales lies once again in higher-dimensional
  rewriting~\cite{CalkGMS22,CalkMPS23}. Any groupoid, in particular,
  can be lifted to a Dedekind quantale at powerset level, a result
  which will once again be formalised in a companion AFP entry.

  Our components build on extant AFP components for Kleene
  algebras~\cite{ArmstrongSW13}, modal Kleene
  algebras~\cite{GomesGHSW16} and quantales~\cite{Struth18}.
