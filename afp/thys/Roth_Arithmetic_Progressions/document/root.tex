\begin{abstract}
We formalise a proof of Roth's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, a major result in additive 
combinatorics on the existence of 3-term arithmetic progressions in subsets of natural numbers.
To this end, we follow a proof using graph regularity. We employ our recent formalisation of Szemer\'{e}di's 
Regularity Lemma, a major result in extremal graph theory, which we use here to prove
the Triangle Counting Lemma and the Triangle Removal Lemma.
