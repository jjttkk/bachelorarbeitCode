    Transitive Models of Fragments of ZFC

    We extend the ZF-Constructibility library by relativizing theories
    of the Isabelle/ZF and Delta System Lemma sessions to a transitive
    class. We also relativize Paulson's work on Aleph and our former
    treatment of the Axiom of Dependent Choices. This work is a
    prerrequisite to our formalization of the independence of the
    Continuum Hypothesis.
