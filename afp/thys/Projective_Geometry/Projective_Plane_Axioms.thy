locale projective_plane =
  (* One has a type of points *)
  (* One has a type of lines *)
  (* One has an incidence relation between points and lines *)
  (* which is all expressed in the following line *)
  fixes incid :: "'point \<Rightarrow> 'line \<Rightarrow> bool"

  (* Ax1: Any two (distinct) points lie on a (unique) line *)
  assumes ax1: "\<exists>l. incid P l \<and> incid Q l"

  (* Ax2: Any two (distinct) lines meet in a (unique) point *)
  assumes ax2: "\<exists>P. incid P l \<and> incid P m"

  (* The uniqueness part *)
  assumes ax_uniqueness: "\<lbrakk>incid P l; incid Q l; incid P m; incid Q m\<rbrakk> \<Longrightarrow>  P = Q \<or> l = m"

  (* Ax3: There exists four points such that no three of them are collinear *)
  assumes ax3: "\<exists>A B C D. distinct [A,B,C,D] \<and> (\<forall>l.
