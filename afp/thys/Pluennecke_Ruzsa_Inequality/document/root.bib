	abstract = {In this expository article we present an overview of the Pl{\"u}nnecke--Ruzsa inequality: the known proofs, some of its well-known applications and possible extensions. We begin with the graph-theoretic setting in which Pl{\"u}nnecke and later Ruzsa worked in. The more purely combinatorial proofs of the inequality are subsequently presented. In the concluding sections we discuss the sharpness of the various results presented thus far and possible extensions of the inequality to the non-commutative setting.},
