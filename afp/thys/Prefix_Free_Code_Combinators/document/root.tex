\title{A Combinator Library for Prefix-Free Codes}
\author{Emin Karayel}
\maketitle

\abstract{This entry contains a set of binary encodings for primitive data types, such as
natural numbers, integers, floating-point numbers as well as combinators to construct
encodings for products, lists, sets or functions of/between such types.

For natural numbers and integers, the entry contains various encodings, such as Elias-Gamma-Codes
and exponential Golomb Codes, which are efficient variable-length codes in use by current
compression formats.

A use-case for this library is measuring the persisted size of a complex data structure without
having to hand-craft a dedicated encoding for it, independent of Isabelle's internal
representation.}
