    The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis in Isabelle/ZF

    We redeveloped our formalization of forcing in the set theory framework of
    Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable
    transitive model of ZFC, we construct proper generic extensions
    that satisfy the Continuum Hypothesis and its negation.
