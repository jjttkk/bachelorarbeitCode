\title{Knuth--Morris--Pratt String Search}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The naive algorithm to search for a pattern $p$ within a string $a$ compares
corresponding characters from left to right, and in case of a mismatch,
shifts one position along $a$ and starts again. 
The worst-case time is $O(\lenarray{p}\lenarray{a})$. 

Knuth--Morris--Pratt~\cite{knuth-fast-pattern} 
exploits the knowledge gained from the partial match, 
never re-comparing characters that matched and thereby achieving linear time. 
At the first mismatched character,
it shifts $p$ as far to the right as safely possible. To do so, it consults a
precomputed table, based on the pattern~$p$. The KMP algorithm is proved correct.
