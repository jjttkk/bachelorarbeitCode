\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalise Kneser's Theorem in combinatorics \cite{Nathanson_book, Ruzsa_book} following the proof from the 2014 paper "A short proof of Kneserâ€™s addition theorem for abelian groups" by Matt DeVos \cite{DeVos_Kneser}. We also show a strict version of Kneser's Theorem as well as the Cauchy--Davenport Theorem as a corollary of Kneser's Theorem.
